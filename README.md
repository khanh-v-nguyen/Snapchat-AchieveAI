# Achieve AI and Study Pods

Our feature is an integrated suite of study tools within Snapchat, designed to keep under-resourced students accountable towards achieving their educational goals. This suite includes:
1. Achieve AI - an academic coach, giving under-resourced students personalized academic guidance. 
2. Pods - Pods are dedicated virtual study “rooms” where users can connect, be productive, and hold each other accountable.
	1. Study Streaks - With Achieve AI and Study Pods, students can also monitor their study consistency with Study Streaks (similar to Snapchat streaks).
